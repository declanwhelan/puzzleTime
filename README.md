Puzzle Time!
================

One of those puzzles where the image is jumbled up and you have to re-build it. 
Using Adventure Time images because the cup beside me has finn on it.
Have a look at the image below if you dont understand what images I mean.

As you see there are mini images showing below the puzzle. I added these in as
a little challenge. They hot-swap out the image in the puzzle for whichever one 
you want.
